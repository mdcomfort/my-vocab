# my-vocab
My final capstone project for the Bright Paths program, an ESL Learner's tool.

This project is a dictionary search and vocabulary list app for ESL learners to be able to save vocabulary words to different lists for their own practice and for teacher reference in creating lessons.

MVP:
The application will make queries from a 3rd party English dictionary API.
Users can search for a word and receive the definition back.
Users can "favorite" words, basically saving words to different lists as they choose (learning, mastered, favorites), stored in a database.
